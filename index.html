								<p>1967 indicates the watershed of Hong Kong history. The ideology of localism grasped between the gap of east and the west, followed by the series of social reforms by MacLehose in the 1970s have promoted Hong Kong to be the <em>Four Asian Dragons</em> in a short period of time. The shift in communications technology with broadcast television expanded notions of collective identity — the confusion of resisting British colony and seeking locality was then replaced by capitalism and consumerism. <em>Café de Coral</em> established its first restaurant in Sugar Street, Causeway Bay in 1968, <em>Maxim’s</em> and <em>Fairwood</em> joined the competition in 1972 — <em>Café de Coral</em> already has four branches when <em>McDonald’</em>s begin serving its burger on Paterson Street in 1975. Hong Kong-style fast food has blossomed among the perspective of local standard as an emerging industry.</p>

								<p>The evolution of local fast food and their business strategies are the two-line narrative of Hong Konger’s roots and history — Rootless as the mixed culinary elements from all over the world, neither purely from the east nor the west; Resilience as the opportunism by keeping abreast of trends with limited resources. Truly speciality of Hong Kong, wandering between market competition and local sentiment and nostalgia, Hong Kong-style fast food is a delicate balance between standardized supply and demand and ever changing tastes.</p>

								<p>What are we exactly eating despite all these complex social, cultural, historical and capital context? Ways of consumptions are politicized today, meal strike is regarded as a means of resistance — <em>Maxim’s</em> bearing all the burnt — Eating, consumption and resistance are mutually constitutive, they produce each other and deserves urgent reflections.  </p>
								<p>Deconstructing three major local fast-food chains of Hong Kong, <em>Tai Merry All The Way</em> delve into its ecosystem with their taste profile, space-time distribution as well as the supply-demand mechanisms. While we analyze how local fast foods construct our taste profile, we look into Hong Kongers’ strategies of survival. </p>

								<p>There are over thousand types of digestive enzymes inside us. Imagining these hard workers living inside your tongue, stomach and intestines, eating what you’re eating and excrete nutrients you need to maintain your mechanism. You are a manufacturing industry of several organic compounds.</p>

								<p>What we’re able to digest defines the spectrum of what’s edible to us - and we have been expanding the spectrum of edibles over the centuries along human civilization: we use tools, heat, fermentation, air, chemicals and additives to change the properties of foods to make them more digestible (also assessable and enjoyable), altering the significances of eating from functional purpose to sensational experience. Yet no matter how much coatings and additional values we have created, it always leads to the same destination - nutrients inputs and excretion.</p>

								<p>Our eating habits is a never-ending evolution. It’s diverse selections and modifications based on our genes and how it adapt to the surroundings. Can we modify our digestive system to adapt and enhance the ever-changing eating behaviour? Can we adjust our internal to expand the spectrum of the edible?</p>
								<p>The explorations among these questions begin with our digestive enzymes. From human narrative of enzymes we understand our diversity of dietary habits are based on genes, ethics to geographic properties of our surroundings, history and cultural heritage. For instance lactose-intolerant in some Asians-  in contemporary society we seek external help from enzyme supplements or even different products in the name of enzymes in the market for improving the performance. Yet the technologies and bioengineering of enzymes is not a new topic. Enzyme turns sugars and carbohydrate into carbon dioxide and organic acids as known as fermentation - there’re still lot of potentials and possibilities with digestive enzymes within food industry and human consumptions as they’re under investigations.</p>

								<p>Learning from this non-human narrative of digestive enzymes, we as working organisms of eating and excreting, can we design our excretions to contribute our ecosystem as we are part of the earth, by modifying our properties of digestions? Taking a second recognition of night soil, <em>Dawn Soil</em> is an ongoing project exploring the relationships and possibilities with what to be digested and excreted by human, among ethnical, sociocultural or even political perspective. Putting us as an eating and excreting organisms living in this planet, this half speculative half practical project depicts an alternative and reflections of our identities with current eating behaviour and as well as the experimental approach towards future foods by the means of adaptive digest evolution.</p>

					<p>As different culture would react differently with certain ingredients, how we prepare the food and the way we eat them would reflect our identities. So this roll could provide a framework to investigate these subtleties of different food items towards different cultural background. <em>Turning the roll recipes collected into a publication is my upcoming plan.</em></p>

					<p>These squares are monotypes and pen drawing I made with <a href="https://hoick.co.za/Origin-Coffee" target="_blank">Hoick</a> for an identity concept of Cape Town’s <a href="https://www.originroasting.co.za" target="_blank">first artisanal coffee roaster</a>. These monotype squares are the abstractions of a cup of coffee. Very special experience for me to design with experimental process for unexpected results - which remains a prominent concept in my design works.</p>

					Gabriella Lai (b. Hong Kong) is a multidisciplinary designer who communicates with food and visuals.
						<li> Currently developing experience concepts with <a href="https://www.pm-artcreation.com" target="_blank"> Pointsman </a> </li>

					<p>I like to explore the phenomenons of food by conceptual thinking and cultural sensitivity, interpreting the complexities on our relationships with food within cultural, social or political context.	</p>
					<p>Design is an experimental process of throwing oneself into the deep to catch the essences of the projects, which aesthetics comes with evidence and integrity.</p>
